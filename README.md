To run these notebooks, perform the following tasks after downloading this folder, which will include creating a Python virtual environment containing the necessary libraries:
1. Create a python virtual environment named "ai_env" (or whatever you want to call it) via the following command:
   ```python -m venv ai_env```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```source ai_env\Scripts\activate```
3. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Useful Note
To write all of the requirements in the Python virtual library into "requirements.txt", run the following command:
```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
